## Go Auth

This is a small dating CRUD app built using Go and MySQL.

### Implementation details and assumptions:

Storage:

- MySQL is used as the storage for the application.
- The current design and implementation won't scale to millions of users, but it shows the basic concepts of how to implement a user management system like a dating app using Go and an ORM on top of MySQL.

Security:

- I assumed that the fr√•ont-end will be responsible for utilising the endpoints securely.
- The password is hashed using bcrypt before storing it in the database.

Adding Location to users and distanceFromMe:

- To keep the project simple and achievable in a short time frame, I have used the random package to generate a random location for each user.
- When the user calls the discover endpoint, a call is made to the database, and then a random location is generated for each user. Then all the users are sorted by location ascending and returned back to the request.
- The location number is generated in a way that is always higher then the calling user so it is easy to sort and serve in a response.


#### Endpoints testing:

I have included a postman collection in the root directory of the project. You can import the collection and test the endpoints.

#### Prerequisites:

- Docker
- Docker-compose

#### Installation:

1 - Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/af-md/go-auth

2 - Navigate to the project directory:

    cd go-auth


3 - Run the docker script to run the application with Docker:

    ./docker_run_dev.sh
This script will build the Docker image and run the application in a Docker container.

4 - Test the application by using the postman collection in the root directory of the project. Below there is a guide that litsts the baisc endpoints that are exposed.
